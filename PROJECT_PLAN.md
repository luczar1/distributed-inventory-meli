# PROJECT_PLAN.md

## 1) Context & Problem Statement

Retail chain with per-store local databases and a central database. Current sync every 15 minutes produces stale/incorrect stock online → lost sales and poor UX.

**Goal**: Optimize consistency, reduce stock-update latency, and lower operational risk/cost while keeping security & observability in place.

**Constraints (from challenge)**:
- Tech stack is our choice; backend prototype only
- Simulate persistence (JSON files / in-memory). No real DB required
- Prioritize good error handling, documentation, tests

## 2) Objectives & Non-Functional Targets (NFRs)

- **Consistency first (CP)**: no lost updates; conflicts are explicit and recoverable
- **Latency**: p50 < 50 ms, p95 < 150 ms (local dev)
- **Uptime target**: 99.5%+ for prototype; support graceful degradation (read-only under stress)
- **Operability**: health/readiness endpoints + metrics; fault-tolerant I/O
- **Change safety**: strong test suite (unit, integration, property-based, fault injection)

## 3) Scope

### In scope
- Inventory write model at the store service (adjust/reserve)
- Event log (WAL/Outbox) and central aggregator (read model)
- REST API with basic validation, idempotency, and concurrency control
- Periodic sync worker + manual /sync trigger
- Optional lease lock for multi-process coordination
- Comprehensive resilience patterns (circuit breakers, bulkheads, backpressure)
- Fault injection and property-based testing
- Graceful shutdown and lock management

### Out of scope (for this prototype)
- AuthN/AuthZ, full observability stack (OTel), real DBs/queues, UI

## 4) Architecture Overview

We use a hexagonal (ports & adapters) layout and lightweight CQRS:

```
               +-------------------+
               | Legacy Frontend   |
               +---------+---------+
                         |
                (HTTP: REST JSON)
                         |
+------------------------v------------------------+
|                 Store Service                   |
|  Routes  ->  App  ->  Domain Service            |
|            (Express)   (Inventory)              |
|                |        |                       |
|         +------+        +----------+            |
|         | Repos (JSON)             |            |
|         |  - inventory.repo        |            |
|         |  - eventlog.repo (WAL)   |            |
|         +--------------------------+            |
|   Concurrency: OCC + per-key mutex + (optional) |
|   file-based lease lock for multi-process       |
+------------------------+------------------------+
                         |
                         |  (periodic)
                         v
                +------------------+
                |  Sync Worker     |
                |  - replay events |
                |  - snapshots     |
                |  - compaction    |
                +--------+---------+
                         |
                         v
               +--------------------+
               | Central Inventory  |
               | (derived JSON)     |
               +--------------------+
```

**Why CQRS + event log?**
- Writes become append-only events (idempotent, replayable)
- Central "read model" is recomputable (snapshots + replay)
- Clear separation of concerns and failure isolation

## 5) Key Design Decisions (ADR-style summary)

### ADR-01: Consistency over availability
**Decision**: Use Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) with version per SKU + If-Match/expectedVersion.
**Why**: Prevents lost updates in distributed writes without heavy locks.
**Trade-off**: Some writes return 409 Conflict and must retry.

### ADR-02: Per-key serialization
**Decision**: Use an in-process per-key async mutex to serialize same-SKU mutations within a node process.
**Why**: Removes race conditions; keeps code simpler/faster than global locks.

### ADR-03: Optional lease lock (multi-process)
**Decision**: Add a file-based lease lock (feature-flagged) to coordinate across processes when needed.
**Why**: Pessimistic, time-boxed lock to ensure single writer per SKU across processes—complements OCC.
**Trade-off**: Possible contention; we fail fast (503 + Retry-After) instead of blocking.

### ADR-04: Event-first (Outbox/WAL)
**Decision**: Persist events before state mutation; assign monotonic sequence.
**Why**: Crash-safe; we can always rebuild the state from the log (or snapshot + tail).
**Trade-off**: Slight write complexity; snapshot/compaction offset cost.

### ADR-05: Resilience patterns
- **Circuit Breaker**: Open after N failures on critical ops; cool down; half-open probe
- **Bulkheads**: Separate concurrency pools (API vs Sync)
- **Backpressure**: Token bucket rate limiting (429) + load shedding (503) when queue depth exceeds thresholds
- **Atomic file writes**: write -> fsync/rename pattern to prevent corruption
- **Dead-letter log**: Bad events are quarantined for later triage
- **Graceful shutdown**: Drain requests, flush logs, final sync

## 6) Data Model & Event Schema

### InventoryRecord
```typescript
{
  sku: string,
  storeId: string,
  qty: number (>=0),
  version: number,
  updatedAt: ISO8601
}
```

### Events (append-only)
```typescript
{
  eventId: uuid,
  sequence: number,
  ts: ISO8601,
  type: 'ADJUST' | 'RESERVE',
  payload: { sku, storeId, delta? / qty?, expectedVersion? }
}
```
Idempotent by eventId; dedup enforced in eventlog.repo.

### Central model
Aggregated `{ [storeId]: { [sku]: { qty, version, updatedAt } } }`

### Snapshots
Periodic `central-<sequence>.json` + optional checksum

## 7) API Design (REST)

### Health & Monitoring
- `GET /health/liveness` → `{ status: 'ok' }`
- `GET /health/readiness` → `{ ready, breakers, queueDepth }`
- `GET /metrics` → counters (requests, errors, conflicts, idempotentHits, rateLimited, shed, breakerOpen, fsRetries, snapshots, lock*)

### Inventory Operations
- `GET /stores/:storeId/inventory/:sku` (headers: ETag: <version>)
- `POST /stores/:storeId/inventory/:sku/adjust` `{ delta, expectedVersion? }`
- `POST /stores/:storeId/inventory/:sku/reserve` `{ qty, expectedVersion? }`
- `POST /sync` → one-off sync

### HTTP preconditions & errors
- If-Match (preferred) or body expectedVersion → 409 on mismatch
- Idempotency-Key header → return cached result; 409 if same key + different payload
- Rate limit → 429 (token bucket)
- Load shedding → 503 + Retry-After
- Lock contention (if enabled) → 503 + Retry-After
- Validation errors → 400

## 8) Concurrency & Locking Strategy

- **OCC**: single-record version check; caller retries with backoff+jitter
- **Per-key mutex (process-local)**: cancels intra-process races
- **Lease lock (optional)**: file-based, time-boxed; steal on expiry; fail fast on contention
- **Single-partition writes (future)**: partition SKUs → one writer per partition (alternative to distributed locks)

## 9) Resilience & High-Uptime Techniques

- **Circuit Breaker**: avoid cascading failures; expose breaker state on readiness
- **Bulkheads**: separate resource pools for API vs Sync
- **Backpressure**: token bucket + bounded queue + load shedding
- **Outbox/WAL + Atomic writes**: always recoverable state; no torn files
- **Snapshots + Compaction**: fast boot, bounded log size
- **Dead-letter Queue**: isolate poison events; keep the stream healthy
- **Graceful Shutdown**: drain, final sync, exit cleanly
- **Idempotency**: safe retries end-to-end

## 10) Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: schemas, repos, utilities (retry, atomic write, circuit breaker, lock)
- **Integration tests**: API happy paths, conflicts (409), rate limit (429), shedding (503), sync correctness
- **Concurrency stress**: 100–200 parallel mutations on same SKU → no lost updates; versions strictly increasing
- **Property-based tests**: invariants (qty >= 0, monotonic versions, idempotent replay)
- **Fault injection**: simulate FS errors/timeouts; verify breaker opens, degraded mode (read-only), and recovery
- **Shutdown test**: ensure no data loss on SIGTERM (final state persisted)

## 11) Observability Plan

- Structured logs with pino, request IDs; no console noise
- Metrics endpoint for counters (export-friendly JSON)
- Readiness/liveness for orchestrators/supervisors
- (Optional future) OpenTelemetry traces to stdout/JSON for local dev

## 12) Security & Safety Baseline

- Input validation (Zod) on all boundaries
- No trust in client state; server enforces constraints
- Rate limit and load shedding mitigate resource abuse
- Timestamps in UTC/ISO-8601; numeric safety for quantities (integers only)
- (Future) AuthN/AuthZ, auditing, secret management

## 14) Operational Runbook (Prototype)

### Start Services
```bash
# Start API server
npm run dev

# Start sync worker (optional separate process)
npm run sync-worker

# Or start both together
npm start
```

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check liveness
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health/liveness

# Check readiness
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health/readiness

# View metrics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/metrics
```

### Manual Operations
```bash
# Trigger manual sync
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sync

# Adjust inventory
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/inventory/stores/STORE001/inventory/SKU123/adjust \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"delta": 10}'

# Reserve inventory
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/inventory/stores/STORE001/inventory/SKU123/reserve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"qty": 5}'
```

### Graceful Shutdown
```bash
# Send SIGTERM to gracefully shutdown
kill -TERM <pid>
```

## 15) Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| File corruption / partial writes | Atomic writes + retries |
| Contention under spikes | Backpressure (429/503), breaker, bulkheads |
| Poison events | DLQ with alerting; manual replay after fix |
| Clock skew (TTL locks) | Short TTL + renewals + steal after expiry; prefer OCC as primary guard |
| Test flakiness with timing | Deterministic seeds; avoid arbitrary sleeps |
