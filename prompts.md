# GenAI/Cursor Prompts Used in Development

This document contains all the prompts used with GenAI/Cursor during the development of the distributed inventory system.

## Initial Project Setup

### Prompt 1: Project Initialization
```
Start a new NodeJS project for a distributed inventory system, prioritizing consistency over availability. Use optimistic concurrency (per-SKU versions) and per-key async mutex, simulating persistence with local JSON files, providing a REST API for core inventory operations, emphasizing concurrency, consistency, and error handling, adding fault tolerance (idempotency keys, retries for file writes), observability, and tests. Enforce clean code with an ESLint rule of max-lines: 200 per file. Deliverables: source code, tests, README.md, run.md, prompts.md, and a short architecture note.
```

### Prompt 2: TypeScript Conversion
```
Convert the existing JavaScript project to a Node.js + TypeScript project scaffold, specifying exact file names, scripts, dependencies, and dev dependencies. Add .eslintrc.cjs and .prettierrc with strict rules, including a hard cap of 200 LOC per file, and create a specific repository structure with empty files.
```

## Core Implementation Tasks

### Task 4 — Core types & errors
```
Implement src/core/types.ts with TypeScript types and Zod schemas for SKU, StoreId, Version (number), Quantity (non-negative), InventoryRecord, Command payloads (AdjustStock, ReserveStock with optional expectedVersion), and API request/response DTOs.

Create src/core/errors.ts with domain errors: ConflictError (version mismatch → 409), ValidationError (400), NotFoundError (404), IdempotencyConflictError (409).

Keep both files ≤ 200 LOC each.
```

### Task 6 — Middleware
```
request-id.ts: attach req.id from header or generate a UUID.
validate.ts: reusable Zod validator for req.body/params/query → throw ValidationError.
error-handler.ts: map domain errors to proper HTTP codes (400/404/409/500) and return JSON { error, message }. No stack traces in prod.
```

### Task 7 — Utilities
```
perKeyMutex.ts: simple per-key async mutex that serializes functions by key (acquire(key, fn)).
idempotency.ts: in-memory Map keyed by Idempotency-Key header; persists last result for a TTL; if same key reappears → return previous result.
fsSafe.ts: JSON file read/write with retry (3x exponential backoff) to simulate fault tolerance for disk I/O.
mapLimit.ts: tiny concurrency helper to run N tasks in parallel (used by tests).
```

### Task 8 — Repositories (JSON persistence)
```
Implement inventory.repo.ts to load/save data/store-inventory.json (per-store state) with API: get(sku, storeId), upsert(record), listByStore(storeId).

Implement eventlog.repo.ts as an append-only data/event-log.json with events { id, type, payload, ts }. It should support idempotent appends (skip duplicate id).

Keep public APIs narrow and synchronous wrappers async (all I/O async via fsSafe).
```

### Task 9 — Domain service (consistency-first)
```
Implement inventory.service.ts using optimistic concurrency (each record has a version field).

Implement mutations:
- adjustStock(storeId, sku, delta, expectedVersion, idemKey)
- reserveStock(storeId, sku, qty, expectedVersion, idemKey) (reject if qty > available)

For each SKU, acquire perKeyMutex(sku) to serialize writes.
If expectedVersion is set and doesn't match, throw ConflictError.
On success: increment version, persist via inventory.repo, append event in eventlog.repo, return { qty, version }.
Respect idempotency: same Idempotency-Key returns the first computed result.
```

### Task 10 — Sync worker (simulate distributed sync)
```
Implement sync.worker.ts:
- applyEventsToCentral() reads new events from event-log.json and folds them into central-inventory.json (per-SKU, per-store).
- Expose startSync(intervalMs = 15000) to run periodically, and syncOnce() for tests.
- Make file operations resilient with fsSafe retries.
```

### Task 11 — HTTP API (Express)
```
routes/health.routes.ts: GET /health → { status: 'ok' }.
routes/inventory.routes.ts:
- GET /stores/:storeId/inventory/:sku → current store record + ETag header = version.
- POST /stores/:storeId/inventory/:sku/adjust → body { delta, expectedVersion? }
- POST /stores/:storeId/inventory/:sku/reserve → body { qty, expectedVersion? }
- POST /sync → triggers syncOnce() (manual sync)

Validate payloads with Zod; surface errors via error-handler.
Include idempotency via Idempotency-Key header.
Ensure every route file ≤ 200 LOC.
```

### Task 12 — App & Server bootstrap
```
app.ts: build express() app (json body parser, request-id, routes, error handler).
server.ts: create HTTP server on PORT (default 3000); start startSync(15000).
```

### Task 13 — Seed data
```
Create minimal JSON seeds:
- data/store-inventory.json: a few SKUs with qty, version: 1, recent timestamps.
- data/central-inventory.json: maybe empty at start.
- data/event-log.json: empty array.
```

## Testing Implementation

### Task 14 — Tests (unit + integration)
```
Use Vitest + Supertest. Add the following:

inventory.service.test.ts
- adjusts increase/decrease correctly; version increments
- rejects negative resulting stock
- expectedVersion mismatch → ConflictError
- idempotency returns same result for repeated key

concurrency.test.ts
- run 100 parallel adjustments/reservations on same SKU using mapLimit with concurrency 16
- ensure final quantity is correct and no lost updates (versions strictly increasing)

api.test.ts
- happy paths for GET/POST adjust/reserve
- 409 on version mismatch (simulate with stale expectedVersion)
- POST /sync applies events into central file (assert central state updated)

Make tests deterministic, no sleeps beyond what's necessary; use syncOnce() instead of timers.
```

## Observability Implementation

### Task 15 — Observability
```
Log every request with { method, url, status, durationMs, requestId }.

Add a lightweight /metrics route returning JSON counters: { requests, errors, conflicts, idempotentHits }.

Increment counters in middleware/service.
```

## Resilience & High-Uptime Implementation

### Task R1 — Centralized Resilience Config
```
Create src/core/config.ts with typed, environment-driven settings (defaults in code).
Include: CONCURRENCY_API, CONCURRENCY_SYNC, RATE_LIMIT_RPS, RATE_LIMIT_BURST, BREAKER_THRESHOLD, BREAKER_COOLDOWN_MS, RETRY_BASE_MS, RETRY_TIMES, SNAPSHOT_EVERY_N_EVENTS, LOAD_SHED_QUEUE_MAX, IDEMP_TTL_MS.
Export a frozen config object.
Acceptance: Unit test asserts sane defaults and reading from process.env.
```

### Task R2 — Atomic JSON writes + stronger fs retries
```
Upgrade src/utils/fsSafe.ts:
Add writeJsonAtomic(path, data) using writeFile(tmp) -> rename(tmp, path) to ensure atomicity.
Keep readJsonSafe, add withFsRetry(fn) that retries with exponential backoff + jitter using config.
All repo writes use writeJsonAtomic wrapped in withFsRetry.
Acceptance: New tests inject transient fs errors (see Task R11) and verify eventual success.
```

### Task R3 — Outbox/WAL semantics (event first, state second)
```
In src/domain/inventory.service.ts and src/domain/eventlog.repo.ts:
Ensure event append (with monotonic sequence) happens before state mutation.
Add sequence field to events; ensure idempotent append (skip duplicate eventId).
On server boot, replay the event log to bring store/central models to a consistent state (new replayOnBoot() in sync.worker.ts).
Acceptance: Boot test: delete derived files, run replayOnBoot(), state matches events.
```

### Task R4 — Snapshots & Log Compaction
```
Create src/ops/snapshotter.ts:
maybeSnapshot() creates data/snapshots/central-<sequence>.json every SNAPSHOT_EVERY_N_EVENTS.
compactEventLog() truncates applied events up to last snapshot.
Integrate into sync flow.
Acceptance: After N events, snapshot exists; replay from snapshot + tail events yields the same state.
```

### Task R5 — Circuit Breaker
```
Create src/utils/circuitBreaker.ts with threshold/cooldown logic.
Wire into sync worker and critical paths.
Acceptance: Breaker opens after threshold failures, recovers after cooldown.
```

### Task R6 — Bulkheads (Resource Isolation)
```
Create src/utils/bulkhead.ts with bounded concurrency for API vs sync.
Wire into app.ts and sync.worker.ts.
Acceptance: API stays responsive when sync is overloaded.
```

### Task R7 — Backpressure: token bucket + load shedding
```
Add src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts (in-memory token bucket using RATE_LIMIT_RPS/BURST).
Add src/middleware/loadShedding.ts that checks a bounded work queue depth (expose getQueueDepth() from service) and, if > LOAD_SHED_QUEUE_MAX, returns 503 with Retry-After.
Wire both middlewares in app.ts only for mutation routes.
Acceptance: Integration tests receive 429 for rate limit and 503 when queue is full; counters recorded.
```

### Task R8 — Stronger HTTP preconditions (If-Match)
```
In routes/inventory.routes.ts, accept If-Match header for the current version. If present and mismatched → 409.
Keep body expectedVersion for clients without headers.
Acceptance: Tests cover both header and body preconditions.
```

### Task R9 — Dead-letter log
```
In src/domain/eventlog.repo.ts and sync.worker.ts:
Track per-event apply failures; after N retries move event to data/dead-letter.json (append-only, atomic write).
Continue processing remaining events.
Acceptance: When a crafted "bad" event appears, it lands in DLQ and the worker continues.
```

### Task R10 — Health, readiness & metrics
```
Enhance routes/health.routes.ts:
GET /health/liveness → {status:'ok'}
GET /health/readiness → { ready: boolean, breakers: {...}, queueDepth } (not ready if any critical breaker is open or queue is over threshold)
GET /metrics → JSON counters: requests, errors, conflicts, idempotentHits, rateLimited, shed, breakerOpen, fsRetries, snapshots.
Acceptance: Metrics update during tests; readiness flips false when opening the breaker or saturating queue.
```

### Task R11 — Fault-injection hooks & property-based tests
```
Add src/testing/faults.ts with toggles to randomly throw fs errors or delays while testing.
Add fast-check dev-dependency; write property-based tests asserting invariants under concurrency: qty >= 0, version strictly increasing, no lost updates.
Add a resilience test that enables fault injection: verify breaker opens, service degrades to read-only (mutations get 503), and recovers.
Acceptance: Tests deterministic and green.
```

### Task R12 — Graceful shutdown
```
In src/server.ts: On SIGTERM/SIGINT, stop accepting new requests, drain bulkheads/queues, flush logs, run one last syncOnce(), exit 0.
Acceptance: Integration test simulates shutdown and ensures no in-flight write is lost (final state persisted).
```

### Task R13 — Strong idempotency improvements
```
In src/utils/idempotency.ts, store {status, resultHash, createdAt} with TTL.
If same key + semantically equal payload (hash) → return cached result; if same key + different payload → return 409 IdempotencyConflict.
Acceptance: Tests cover duplicate key same/different payloads.
```

### Task R14 — Separate worker bootstrap
```
Create src/sync.bootstrap.ts that can run the sync worker independent from the API process (still same codebase).
Update run.md with commands to start API only, worker only, or both.
Acceptance: Manual e2e: API keeps serving while worker is busy; bulkheads isolate spikes.
```

### Task R15 — Documentation updates
```
Update ARCHITECTURE.md: document Outbox/WAL, Snapshots/Compaction, Circuit Breaker, Bulkheads, Backpressure, DLQ, Graceful Shutdown, and trade-offs (Consistency > Availability).
Update README.md with new endpoints (/health/*, /metrics) and configuration knobs.
Update openapi.yaml to include 429, 503, 409 (If-Match), and headers (Retry-After).
Acceptance: Docs lint clean; examples in run.md (cURL) demonstrate 409/429/503 paths.
```

### Task R16 — Quality gate refresh
```
Ensure all new/modified files remain ≤250 LOC (split utilities if needed).
Add lint rule max-lines-per-function (e.g., 60) to keep functions small.
npm run lint and npm test must pass.
Acceptance: CI (local scripts) green; file sizes audited.
```

## Distributed Locking Implementation

### Task L1 — Feature flags & config for locking
```
Add lock config to src/core/config.ts and export:
LOCKS_ENABLED (default false)
LOCK_TTL_MS (default 2000)
LOCK_RENEW_MS (default 1000) — if op lasts longer than half TTL, renew
LOCK_DIR (default data/locks)
LOCK_REJECT_STATUS (default 503) and LOCK_RETRY_AFTER_MS (default 300)
LOCK_OWNER_ID = ${process.pid}-${crypto.randomUUID()}
Acceptance: Config reads from process.env, is frozen, and has sane defaults (unit test in tests/config.locks.test.ts).
```

### Task L2 — Lock file lease utility (atomic, steal on expiry)
```
Create src/utils/lockFile.ts (≤200 LOC) with API:
export type LockHandle = { key: string; file: string; owner: string; expiresAt: number };
export async function acquireLock(key: string, ttlMs: number, owner: string): Promise<LockHandle>;
export async function renewLock(h: LockHandle, ttlMs: number): Promise<LockHandle>; // returns updated handle
export async function releaseLock(h: LockHandle): Promise<void>;
export async function isLocked(key: string): Promise<boolean>;

Behavior (implement exactly):
Acquire: try fs.writeFile(file, payload, { flag: 'wx' }) (exclusive create). Payload: { owner, expiresAt }.
If exists: read JSON; if expiresAt < now(), attempt steal: fs.rm(file) then retry wx. If rm/write fails due to race, treat as held.
Renew: read file; if owner mismatches → throw LOCK_LOST. Otherwise write new { owner, expiresAt: now+ttl }.
Release: read & verify owner, then fs.rm(file, { force: true }). If mismatch → throw LOCK_LOST. (On shutdown you may force without verify; see L5.)
Ensure await fs.mkdir(LOCK_DIR, { recursive: true }) on first use.

Edge handling:
Use monotonic Date.now().
No busy-wait loops; let caller backoff.
No global state beyond helper functions.

Acceptance: Unit tests in tests/lockFile.unit.test.ts cover: acquire, contention (only one wins), renew, release, steal after TTL, and owner mismatch error.
```

### Task L3 — Service integration behind a flag
```
Modify src/domain/inventory.service.ts:
If LOCKS_ENABLED:
Before any mutation on a sku, call acquireLock(sku, LOCK_TTL_MS, LOCK_OWNER_ID).
If acquireLock throws (held by another): fail fast with LOCK_REJECT_STATUS and Retry-After: LOCK_RETRY_AFTER_MS/1000.
For long ops, if time since acquire ≥ LOCK_RENEW_MS, call renewLock.
In finally, always releaseLock.
Keep OCC and per-key mutex as-is. (Order: lock → mutex/critical section → OCC mutate → release.)
Acceptance: Integration tests in tests/locks.api.test.ts:
Two concurrent adjustments on same sku: one succeeds, the other gets LOCK_REJECT_STATUS with Retry-After.
When LOCKS_ENABLED=false, behavior matches pre-lock tests.
```

### Task L4 — Metrics & HTTP behavior
```
Extend metrics with counters: lockAcquired, lockContended, lockStolen, lockExpired, lockLost, lockReleaseFailures.
Increment in the lock utility or service wrapper.
Return headers on lock rejection: Retry-After: <seconds>, X-Lock-Key: <sku>.
Acceptance: tests/locks.metrics.test.ts asserts counters increment and headers are present.
```

### Task L5 — Graceful shutdown + lock cleanup
```
In src/server.ts: Track active LockHandles in a weak registry.
On SIGTERM/SIGINT: stop accepting requests, attempt release of any held locks (ignore LOCK_LOST), run one syncOnce(), exit 0.
Acceptance: Test in tests/locks.shutdown.test.ts simulates a held lock, triggers shutdown handler, and verifies the lock file is removed (or expired soon if removal fails).
```

### Task L6 — Documentation & flags
```
Update docs:
README.md: explain the optional lease lock and how it complements OCC. Describe fallback (fast fail + Retry-After).
ARCHITECTURE.md: add a short section "Locking strategy: per-key in-process mutex + file lease (optional)" with sequence: acquire → mutate → release; and steal on expiry flow.
run.md: show how to run with LOCKS_ENABLED=true, and sample cURL demonstrating lock contention.
Acceptance: Docs build pass lint; examples run.
```

### Task L7 — Stress & contention tests
```
Add tests/locks.stress.test.ts using your mapLimit helper:
Run 50–200 parallel adjust calls on the same SKU with LOCKS_ENABLED=true.
Expect: some LOCK_REJECT_STATUS, no lost updates, versions strictly increase, and end quantity matches expected net delta from successful ops.
Acceptance: Deterministic success locally (seed jitter if needed).
```

## OpenAPI Documentation
